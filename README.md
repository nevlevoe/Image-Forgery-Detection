# üïµÔ∏è Image Forgery Detection

A lightweight and effective image forgery detection tool using multiple forgery methods. Includes pretrained models and a Streamlit-based interactive interface.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r versionstxt.txt
```

> ‚úÖ Recommended Python version: **3.10**

---

## üì• Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevlevoe/Image-Forgery-Detection.git
cd Image-Forgery-Detection
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Download Pretrained Model Files

The following model files are **not included** in the repository due to size limits:

- `casiamvssnet.pt`
- `defactomvssnet.pt`
- `best_combined_resnet_model.pth`
- `model.weights.pth`
- `modelfinal.weights.pth`

üìÇ Download and extract all of them from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CygKYYN82a3kPRgSQVfmmNoE_Kwh9QtI/view?usp=sharing) and place them:

- In the **same directory** as `app_traditionalforg.py`, **or**
- In the **root folder** of the cloned repo

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the App via Streamlit

Once dependencies are installed and models are in place, run:

```bash
streamlit run app_traditionalforg.py
```

‚úÖ The app will launch in your browser. Upload an image and see forgery detection results powered by pretrained models.
üìÇ Download and extract some test pictures from [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_kVoFBsQS2n6Di6FIdVxmiF8vt-sDFcW/view?usp=sharing) and use them to upload and test the model:
